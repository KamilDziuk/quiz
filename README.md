This project is a quiz-style website where each question comes with a set of predefined answers, each associated with specific values. Users select answers by checking the corresponding checkboxes, and after marking all the desired options, they can click the "Diagnose" button. Once clicked, the website will display the values of the selected answers.

The website is built using JavaScript for functionality and CSS for styling.
